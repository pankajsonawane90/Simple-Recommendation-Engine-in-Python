# Simple-Recommendation-System/Engine-in-Python

This is an introduction towards basic recommender systems/engine. This recommender system will be built in Python. Pandas and Numpy libraries are the prerequisite for this.

## Basic information about recommender system:

A recommender system or recommendation engine is a simple algorithm which aims to provide the most relevant information to the user after discovering various patterns from the given dataset. This algorithm will rate the items and show the user the items that they would rate highly. Recommendation systems are used by many e-commerce websites like movie and music streaming applications to recommend the items that you might like.

E.g. Item X and Y are bought by two users from online store. After this purchase, the similarity index of these two users is computed. Depending on the score, the system can recommend item Z to other user because it detects that other two previous users are similar in terms of the items they purchased.

## Types of recommender system:

There are basically three important types of recommendation systems:

###### 1. Collaborative filtering: 

Collaborative filtering is the method of making automatic filtering about the choices of a particular user by collecting preferences or taste information from many other users (collaborating).

###### 2. Content-Based Filtering:

Content-based filtering, recommends items based on a comparison between the content of the items and a user profile. The content of each item is represented as a set of different terms, normally the words that arise frequently in a document. The user profile is represented with the same terms and built up by analyzing the content of items which have been seen by the user.

###### 3. Hybrid Recommendation Systems:

Hybrid recommender systems is been created by combining collaborative filtering and content-based filtering. It gives more accurate results in some cases.
