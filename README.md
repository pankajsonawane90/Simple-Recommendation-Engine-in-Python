# Simple-Recommendation-Engine-in-Python

This is an introduction towards basic recommender systems/engine. This recommender system will be built in Python. Pandas and Numpy libraries are the prerequisite for this.

## Basic information about recommender system:

A recommender system or recommendation engine is a simple algorithm which aims to provide the most relevant information to the user after discovering various patterns from the given dataset. This algorithm will rate the items and show the user the items that they would rate highly. Recommendation systems are used by many e-commerce websites like movie and music streaming applications to recommend the items that you might like.

E.g. Item X and Y are bought by two users from online store. After this purchase, the similarity index of these two users is computed. Depending on the score, the system can recommend item Z to other user because it detects that other two previous users are similar in terms of the items they purchased.

## Types of recommender system:

There are basically three important types of recommendation systems:

1. Collaborative filtering.
2. Content-Based Filtering.
3. Hybrid Recommendation Systems.
